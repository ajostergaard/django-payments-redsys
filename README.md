### About order numbers

Redsys requires your payments to include an order number (alphanumeric, 4 to 12 chars) that must be unique per merchant.

With this `RedsysProvider` you can either include an `order_number` in your Payment model (field or property), or a default one will be generated based on the setting `order_number_prefix` and the payment instance's primary key.


## Sample project

This repo contains the seed of sample project that you can look at for inspiration and reference. It is a minimalistic django project, it has enough to be used in automated tests. You can also run it with `just sample-app`.


## Development

You may use the `justfile` tool to run most commands in the development workflow (run the sample app, tests, etc.). Call `just` on a terminal to see all available options.

We use `poetry` and `pyproject.toml`. Get set up and check that things work with:

```sh
poetry install
just test
```
